# Probability-Theory-in-Finance-Course-Project
This project models and analyzes market volatility using GARCH(1,1) and Heston models with S\&amp;P 500 and VIX data. It covers parameter estimation (MLE, Nelderâ€“Mead), performance evaluation, market-regime analysis( high vs low volatility period ), and predictive regressions( GARCH, Heston and combined model ) for next-day realized volatility.
